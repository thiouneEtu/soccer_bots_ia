## Multi-agent systems: soccer team
Development of a SoccerBots team under the TeamBots simulator. This project is part of a practical application of the knowledge acquired in the Distributed Artificial Intelligence module, MSc of Computer Science University Caen Normandie.
You can be inspired by this team to create your own, or have it play against your own.

## Run
- First download and install the Teambots API by folowing informations from this [link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/#APPLICATIONS)
- Go to the Soccerbots folder
- Launch the compilation with : make all
- Run the simulation with : ./demo

## Results

## Conclusion
In sum, this project allowed us to put into practice the different strategies of multi-agent systems seen in class (subsumption, attraction-repulsion, etc.), and to have an overview of the operation of these types of architectures. However, in this type of programming, it is rare to find a tactic that is entirely unfailing. There will probably be a team that can beat ours because it has adopted the most optimal choices. The best solution would be to develop a team that adapts to the opponent's behaviors and respond according to his actions. Such a team could be more efficient from a competitive point of view. Our strategy is still quite competitive, having allowed us to beat some teams because the agents adopt non-trivial behaviors.
