## Multi-agent systems: soccer team
Development of a SoccerBots team under the TeamBots simulator. This project is part of a practical application of the knowledge acquired in the Distributed Artificial Intelligence module, Master (first year) Computer Science University Caen Normandie.
You can be inspired by this team to create your own, or have it play against your own.

## Run
- First download the Teambots API 
- Go to the Soccerbots folder
- Launch the compilation with : make all
- Run the simulation with : ./demo

## Thanks :)
